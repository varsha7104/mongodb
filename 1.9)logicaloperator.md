## Logical Operator
When we want to get some specified conditions
There are some logical operator
1) $and: returns document where both queries match ```{$and:[condition1,condition2]}
ex:
```
 {age:{$lt:20}} {"city":"New Delhi"}
```
ex:

```
db.students.find($and:[{age:25},{city:"New Delhi"}])

```
It gives us the condition where age is less than 20 and city is new Delhi
3) $or: returns document where any one od the condition is true
 ex: 
 
```
 {age:{$lt:20}} {"city":"New Delhi"}

```
It gives us the condition where age is less than 20 and city is new Delhi
3)$nor :returns the documents where both queries fail to match.

{$nor:[condition1,condition2]}
4) $not : returns document where the query does not match
   {$not:[condition]}
   ex: 
   
```
db.students.find({"age":{$not:{$gt:25}}})
db.students.find({and:[{course:"Btech"},{name:"Varsha"}]})

```
